( #915 via Dmitry Labazkin ) Changes Due to compatibility issues with newer package versions, certain functions from six.py have been removed so that mlxtend may not work anymore with Python 2.7. As an internal change to speed up unit testing, unit testing is now faciliated by GitHub workflows, and Travis CI and Appveyor hooks have been removed. Improved axis label rotation in mlxtend.plotting.heatmap and mlxtend.plotting.plot_confusion_matrix ( #872 ) Fix various typos in McNemar guides.

( #764 ) Adds new scatter_hist function to mlxtend.plotting for generating a scattered histogram. ( #757 via Maitreyee Mhasaka ) The evaluate.permutation_test function now accepts a paired argument to specify to support paired permutation/randomization tests. ( #768 ) The StackingCVRegressor now also supports multi-dimensional targets similar to StackingRegressor via StackingCVRegressor(..., multi_output=True) . ( #802 via Marco Tiraboschi ) Changes Updates unit tests for scikit-learn 0.24.1 compatibility. ( #774 ) StackingRegressor now requires setting StackingRegressor(..., multi_output=True) if the target is multi-dimensional; this allows for better input validation. ( #802 ) Removes deprecated res argument from plot_decision_regions . ( #803 ) Adds a title_fontsize parameter to plot_learning_curves for controlling the title font size; also the plot style is now the matplotlib default.

( #726 Adds new create_counterfactual method for creating counterfactuals to explain model predictions. ( #740 ) Changes permutation_test ( mlxtend.evaluate.permutation ) \u00ecs corrected to give the proportion of permutations whose statistic is at least as extreme as the one observed. ( #721 via Florian Charlier ) Fixes the McNemar confusion matrix layout to match the convention (and documentation), swapping the upper left and lower right cells. ( #744 via mmarius ) Bug Fixes The loss in LogisticRegression for logging purposes didn't include the L2 penalty for the first weight in the weight vector (this is not the bias unit). However, since this loss function was only used for logging purposes, and the gradient remains correct, this does not have an effect on the main code. ( #741 ) Fixes a bug in bias_variance_decomp where when the mse loss was used, downcasting to integers caused imprecise results for small numbers.

( #688 ) Fixes an issue in fpmax that could lead to incorrect support values. ( #692 via Steve Harenberg ) Version 0.17.2 (2020-02-24) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features - Changes The previously deprecated OnehotTransactions has been removed in favor of the TransactionEncoder. Removed SparseDataFrame support in frequent pattern mining functions in favor of pandas >=1.0's new way for working sparse data. If you used SparseDataFrame formats, please see pandas' migration guide at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/sparse.html#migrating. ( #667 ) The plot_confusion_matrix.py now also accepts a matplotlib figure and axis as input to which the confusion matrix plot can be added. ( #671 via Vahid Mirjalili ) Bug Fixes - Version 0.17.1 (2020-01-28) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features The SequentialFeatureSelector now supports using pre-specified feature sets via the fixed_features parameter. ( #578 ) Adds a new accuracy_score function to mlxtend.evaluate for computing basic classifcation accuracy, per-class accuracy, and average per-class accuracy. ( #624 via Deepan Das ) StackingClassifier and StackingCVClassifier now have a decision_function method, which serves as a preferred choice over predict_proba in calculating roc_auc and average_precision scores when the meta estimator is a linear model or support vector classifier. ( #634 via Qiang Gu ) Changes Improve the runtime performance for the apriori frequent itemset generating function when low_memory=True . Setting low_memory=False (default) is still faster for small itemsets, but low_memory=True can be much faster for large itemsets and requires less memory. Also, input validation for apriori , \u0300 fpgrowth and fpmax takes a significant amount of time when input pandas DataFrame is large; this is now dramatically reduced when input contains boolean values (and not zeros/ones), which is the case when using TransactionEncoder`. ( #619 via Denis Barbier ) Add support for newer sparse pandas DataFrame for frequent itemset algorithms. Also, input validation for apriori , \u0300 fpgrowth and fpmax` runs much faster on sparse DataFrame when input pandas DataFrame contains integer values. ( #621 via Denis Barbier ) Let fpgrowth and fpmax directly work on sparse DataFrame, they were previously converted into dense Numpy arrays. ( #622 via Denis Barbier ) Bug Fixes Fixes a bug in mlxtend.plotting.plot_pca_correlation_graph that caused the explaind variances not summing up to 1. Also, improves the runtime performance of the correlation computation and adds a missing function argument for the explained variances (eigenvalues) if users provide their own principal components. ( #593 via Gabriel Azevedo Ferreira ) Behavior of fpgrowth and apriori consistent for edgecases such as min_support=0 . ( #573 via Steve Harenberg ) fpmax returns an empty data frame now instead of raising an error if the frequent itemset set is empty. ( #573 via Steve Harenberg ) Fixes and issue in mlxtend.plotting.plot_confusion_matrix , where the font-color choice for medium-dark cells was not ideal and hard to read. #588 via sohrabtowfighi ) The svd mode of mlxtend.feature_extraction.PrincipalComponentAnalysis now also n-1 degrees of freedom instead of n d.o.f. when computing the eigenvalues to match the behavior of eigen . #595 Disable input validation for StackingCVClassifier because it causes issues if pipelines are used as input. #606 Version 0.17.0 (2019-07-19) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features Added an enhancement to the existing iris_data() such that both the UCI Repository version of the Iris dataset as well as the corrected, original version of the dataset can be loaded, which has a slight difference in two data points (consistent with Fisher's paper; this is also the same as in R). (via #539 via janismdhanbad ) Added optional groups parameter to SequentialFeatureSelector and ExhaustiveFeatureSelector fit() methods for forwarding to sklearn CV ( #537 via arc12 ) Added a new plot_pca_correlation_graph function to the mlxtend.plotting submodule for plotting a PCA correlation graph. ( #544 via Gabriel-Azevedo-Ferreira ) Added a zoom_factor parameter to the mlxten.plotting.plot_decision_region function that allows users to zoom in and out of the decision region plots. ( #545 ) Added a function fpgrowth that implements the FP-Growth algorithm for mining frequent itemsets as a drop-in replacement for the existing apriori algorithm. ( #550 via Steve Harenberg ) New heatmap function in mlxtend.plotting . ( #552 ) Added a function fpmax that implements the FP-Max algorithm for mining maximal itemsets as a drop-in replacement for the fpgrowth algorithm. ( #553 via Steve Harenberg ) New figsize parameter for the plot_decision_regions function in mlxtend.plotting . ( #555 via Mirza Hasanbasic ) New low_memory option for the apriori frequent itemset generating function. Setting low_memory=False (default) uses a substantially optimized version of the algorithm that is 3-6x faster than the original implementation ( low_memory=True ). ( #567 via jmayse ) Added numerically stable OLS methods which uses QR decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods to LinearRegression in mlxtend.regressor.linear_regression . ( #575 via PuneetGrov3r ) Changes Now uses the latest joblib library under the hood for multiprocessing instead of sklearn.externals.joblib . ( #547 ) Changes to StackingCVClassifier and StackingCVRegressor such that first-level models are allowed to generate output of non-numeric type. ( #562 ) Bug Fixes Fixed documentation of iris_data() under iris.py by adding a note about differences in the iris data in R and UCI machine learning repo. Make sure that if the 'svd' mode is used in PCA, the number of eigenvalues is the same as when using 'eigen' (append 0's zeros in that case) ( #565 ) Version 0.16.0 (2019-05-12) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features StackingCVClassifier and StackingCVRegressor now support random_state parameter, which, together with shuffle , controls the randomness in the cv splitting. ( #523 via Qiang Gu ) StackingCVClassifier and StackingCVRegressor now have a new drop_last_proba parameter. It drops the last \"probability\" column in the feature set since if True , because it is redundant: p(y_c) = 1 - p(y_1) + p(y_2) + ... + p(y_{c-1}). This can be useful for meta-classifiers that are sensitive to perfectly collinear features. ( #532 ) Other stacking estimators, including StackingClassifier , StackingCVClassifier and StackingRegressor , support grid search over the regressors and even a single base regressor. ( #522 via Qiang Gu ) Adds multiprocessing support to StackingCVClassifier . ( #522 via Qiang Gu ) Adds multiprocessing support to StackingCVRegressor . ( #512 via Qiang Gu ) Now, the StackingCVRegressor also enables grid search over the regressors and even a single base regressor. When there are level-mixed parameters, GridSearchCV will try to replace hyperparameters in a top-down order (see the documentation for examples details). ( #515 via Qiang Gu ) Adds a verbose parameter to apriori to show the current iteration number as well as the itemset size currently being sampled. ( #519 Adds an optional class_name parameter to the confusion matrix function to display class names on the axis as tick marks. ( #487 via sandpiturtle ) Adds a pca.e_vals_normalized_ attribute to PCA for storing the eigenvalues also in normalized form; this is commonly referred to as variance explained ratios. #545 Changes Due to new features, restructuring, and better scikit-learn support (for GridSearchCV , etc.) the StackingCVRegressor 's meta regressor is now being accessed via 'meta_regressor__* in the parameter grid. E.g., if a RandomForestRegressor as meta- egressor was previously tuned via 'randomforestregressor__n_estimators' , this has now changed to 'meta_regressor__n_estimators' . ( #515 via Qiang Gu ) The same change mentioned above is now applied to other stacking estimators, including StackingClassifier , StackingCVClassifier and StackingRegressor . ( #522 via Qiang Gu ) Automatically performs mean centering for PCA solver 'SVD' such that using SVD is always equal to using the covariance matrix approach #545 Bug Fixes The feature_selection.ColumnSelector now also supports column names of type int (in addition to str names) if the input is a pandas DataFrame. ( #500 via tetrar124 Fix unreadable labels in plot_confusion_matrix for imbalanced datasets if show_absolute=True and show_normed=True . ( #504 ) Raises a more informative error if a SparseDataFrame is passed to apriori and the dataframe has integer column names that don't start with 0 due to current limitations of the SparseDataFrame implementation in pandas. ( #503 ) SequentialFeatureSelector now supports DataFrame as input for all operating modes (forward/backward/floating). #506 mlxtend.evaluate.feature_importance_permutation now correctly accepts scoring functions with proper function signature as metric argument. #528 Version 0.15.0 (2019-01-19) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features Adds a new transformer class to mlxtend.image , EyepadAlign , that aligns face images based on the location of the eyes. ( #466 by Vahid Mirjalili ) Adds a new function, mlxtend.evaluate.bias_variance_decomp that decomposes the loss of a regressor or classifier into bias and variance terms. ( #470 ) Adds a whitening parameter to PrincipalComponentAnalysis , to optionally whiten the transformed data such that the features have unit variance. ( #475 ) Changes Changed the default solver in PrincipalComponentAnalysis to 'svd' instead of 'eigen' to improve numerical stability. ( #474 ) The mlxtend.image.extract_face_landmarks now returns None if no facial landmarks were detected instead of an array of all zeros. ( #466 ) Bug Fixes The eigenvectors maybe have not been sorted in certain edge cases if solver was 'eigen' in PrincipalComponentAnalysis and LinearDiscriminantAnalysis . ( #477 , #478 ) Version 0.14.0 (2018-11-09) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features Added a scatterplotmatrix function to the plotting module. ( #437 ) Added sample_weight option to StackingRegressor , StackingClassifier , StackingCVRegressor , StackingCVClassifier , EnsembleVoteClassifier . ( #438 ) Added a RandomHoldoutSplit class to perform a random train/valid split without rotation in SequentialFeatureSelector , scikit-learn GridSearchCV etc. ( #442 ) Added a PredefinedHoldoutSplit class to perform a train/valid split, based on user-specified indices, without rotation in SequentialFeatureSelector , scikit-learn GridSearchCV etc. ( #443 ) Created a new mlxtend.image submodule for working on image processing-related tasks. ( #457 ) Added a new convenience function extract_face_landmarks based on dlib to mlxtend.image . ( #458 ) Added a method='oob' option to the mlxtend.evaluate.bootstrap_point632_score method to compute the classic out-of-bag bootstrap estimate ( #459 ) Added a method='.632+' option to the mlxtend.evaluate.bootstrap_point632_score method to compute the .632+ bootstrap estimate that addresses the optimism bias of the .632 bootstrap ( #459 ) Added a new mlxtend.evaluate.ftest function to perform an F-test for comparing the accuracies of two or more classification models. ( #460 ) Added a new mlxtend.evaluate.combined_ftest_5x2cv function to perform an combined 5x2cv F-Test for comparing the performance of two models. ( #461 ) Added a new mlxtend.evaluate.difference_proportions test for comparing two proportions (e.g., classifier accuracies) ( #462 ) Changes Addressed deprecations warnings in NumPy 0.15. ( #425 ) Because of complications in PR ( #459 ), Python 2.7 was now dropped; since official support for Python 2.7 by the Python Software Foundation is ending in approx. 12 months anyways, this re-focussing will hopefully free up some developer time with regard to not having to worry about backward compatibility Bug Fixes Fixed an issue with a missing import in mlxtend.plotting.plot_confusion_matrix . ( #428 ) Version 0.13.0 (2018-07-20) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features A meaningful error message is now raised when a cross-validation generator is used with SequentialFeatureSelector . ( #377 ) The SequentialFeatureSelector now accepts custom feature names via the fit method for more interpretable feature subset reports. ( #379 ) The SequentialFeatureSelector is now also compatible with Pandas DataFrames and uses DataFrame column-names for more interpretable feature subset reports. ( #379 ) ColumnSelector now works with Pandas DataFrames columns. ( #378 by Manuel Garrido ) The ExhaustiveFeatureSelector estimator in mlxtend.feature_selection now is safely stoppable mid-process by control+c. ( #380 ) Two new functions, vectorspace_orthonormalization and vectorspace_dimensionality were added to mlxtend.math to use the Gram-Schmidt process to convert a set of linearly independent vectors into a set of orthonormal basis vectors, and to compute the dimensionality of a vectorspace, respectively. ( #382 ) mlxtend.frequent_patterns.apriori now supports pandas SparseDataFrame s to generate frequent itemsets. ( #404 via Daniel Morales ) The plot_confusion_matrix function now has the ability to show normalized confusion matrix coefficients in addition to or instead of absolute confusion matrix coefficients with or without a colorbar. The text display method has been changed so that the full range of the colormap is used. The default size is also now set based on the number of classes. Added support for merging the meta features with the original input features in StackingRegressor (via use_features_in_secondary ) like it is already supported in the other Stacking classes. ( #418 ) Added a support_only to the association_rules function, which allow constructing association rules (based on the support metric only) for cropped input DataFrames that don't contain a complete set of antecedent and consequent support values. ( #421 ) Changes Itemsets generated with apriori are now frozenset s ( #393 by William Laney and #394 ) Now raises an error if a input DataFrame to apriori contains non 0, 1, True, False values. #419 ) Bug Fixes Allow mlxtend estimators to be cloned via scikit-learn's clone function. ( #374 ) Fixes bug to allow the correct use of refit=False in StackingRegressor and StackingCVRegressor ( #384 and ( #385 ) by selay01 ) Allow StackingClassifier to work with sparse matrices when use_features_in_secondary=True ( #408 by Floris Hoogenbook ) Allow StackingCVRegressor to work with sparse matrices when use_features_in_secondary=True ( #416 ) Allow StackingCVClassifier to work with sparse matrices when use_features_in_secondary=True ( #417 ) Version 0.12.0 (2018-21-04) Downloads Source code (zip) Source code (tar.gz) New Features A new feature_importance_permuation function to compute the feature importance in classifiers and regressors via the permutation importance method ( #358 ) The fit method of the ExhaustiveFeatureSelector now optionally accepts **fit_params for the estimator that is used for the feature selection. ( #354 by Zach Griffith) The fit method of the SequentialFeatureSelector now optionally accepts **fit_params for the estimator that is used for the feature selection.

Quick Contributor Checklist This is a quick checklist about the different steps of a typical contribution to mlxtend (and other open source projects). Consider copying this list to a local text file (or the issue tracker) and checking off items as you go. 1) Making and testing code changes: [ ] Open a new \"issue\" on GitHub to discuss the new feature / bug fix [ ] Fork the mlxtend repository from GitHub (if not already done earlier) [ ] Create and check out a new topic branch (please don't make modifications in the master branch) [ ] Implement the new feature or apply the bug-fix [ ] Add appropriate unit test functions in mlxtend/*/tests [ ] Run PYTHONPATH='.' pytest ./mlxtend -sv and make sure that all unit tests pass [ ] Make sure the newly implemented feature has good test coverage: python -m pip install coverage # test all: # coverage run --source=mlxtend --branch -m pytest . coverage run --source=mlxtend --branch -m pytest mlxtend/<insert_path> coverage html [ ] Modify documentation in the appropriate location under mlxtend/docs/sources/ [ ] Add a note about the modification/contribution to the ./docs/sources/changelog.md file 2) Checking code style: When you check in a PR, mlxtend will run code style checks via flak8 and black. To make the contributor experience easier, we recommend you check the code style locally before pushing it to the repository. This way it is less likely that the automated checkers will complain and prompt you to make fixes. There are two ways you can do this: Option A : Running the tools manually [ ] Check for style issues by running flake8 ./mlxtend (you may want to run pytest again after you made modifications to the code) [ ] We recommend using black to format the code automatically according to recommended style changes. After installing black , you can do this via black [source_file_or_directory] [ ] Run isort which will sort the imports alphabetically. We recommend the following command: isort -p mlxtend --line-length 88 --multi-line 3 --profile black mypythonfile.py Option B : Using pre-commit hooks (recommended) The pre-commit hooks for mlxtend will check your code via flake8 , black , and isort automatically before you make a git commit . You can read more about pre-commit hooks here . [ ] Install the pre-commit package via pip install pre-commit . [ ] In the mlxtend folder, run pre-commit install (you only have to do it once). 3) Submitting your code [ ] Push the topic branch to the server and create a pull request. [ ] Check the automated tests passed. [ ] The automatic PEP8 / black integrations may prompt you to modify the code stylistically. It would be nice if you could apply the suggested changes. Tips for Contributors Getting Started - Creating a New Issue and Forking the Repository If you don't have a GitHub account, yet, please create one to contribute to this project. Please submit a ticket for your issue to discuss the fix or new feature before too much time and effort is spent for the implementation. Fork the mlxtend repository from the GitHub web interface. Clone the mlxtend repository to your local machine by executing git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/mlxtend.git Syncing an Existing Fork If you already forked mlxtend earlier, you can bring you \"Fork\" up to date with the master branch as follows: 1. Configuring a remote that points to the upstream repository on GitHub List the current configured remote repository of your fork by executing $ git remote -v If you see something like origin https://github.com/<your username>/mlxtend.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/<your username>/mlxtend.git (push) you need to specify a new remote upstream repository via $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend.git Now, verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork by executing $ git remote -v You should see following output if everything is configured correctly: origin https://github.com/<your username>/mlxtend.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/<your username>/mlxtend.git (push) upstream https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend.git (push) 2. Syncing your Fork First, fetch the updates of the original project's master branch by executing: $ git fetch upstream You should see the following output remote: Counting objects: xx, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (xx/xx), done. remote: Total xx (delta xx), reused xx (delta x) Unpacking objects: 100% (xx/xx), done. From https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend * [new branch] master -> upstream/master This means that the commits to the rasbt/mlxtend master branch are now stored in the local branch upstream/master . If you are not already on your local project's master branch, execute $ git checkout master Finally, merge the changes in upstream/master to your local master branch by executing $ git merge upstream/master which will give you an output that looks similar to Updating xxx...xxx Fast-forward SOME FILE1 | 12 +++++++ SOME FILE2 | 10 +++++++ 2 files changed, 22 insertions(+), *The Main Workflow - Making Changes in a New Topic Branch Listed below are the 9 typical steps of a contribution. 1. Discussing the Feature or Modification Before you start coding, please discuss the new feature, bugfix, or other modification to the project on the project's issue tracker . Before you open a \"new issue,\" please do a quick search to see if a similar issue has been submitted already. 2. Creating a new feature branch Please avoid working directly on the master branch but create a new feature branch: $ git branch <new_feature> Switch to the new feature branch by executing $ git checkout <new_feature> 3. Developing the new feature / bug fix Now it's time to modify existing code or to contribute new code to the project. 4. Testing your code Add the respective unit tests and check if they pass: $ PYTHONPATH='.' pytest ./mlxtend ---with-coverage 5. Documenting changes Please add an entry to the mlxtend/docs/sources/changelog.md file. If it is a new feature, it would also be nice if you could update the documentation in appropriate location in mlxtend/sources . 6. Committing changes When you are ready to commit the changes, please provide a meaningful commit message: $ git add <modifies_files> # or `git add .` $ git commit -m '<meaningful commit message>' 7. Optional: squashing commits If you made multiple smaller commits, it would be nice if you could group them into a larger, summarizing commit. First, list your recent commit via Note Due to the improved GitHub UI, this is no longer necessary/encouraged. $ git log which will list the commits from newest to oldest in the following format by default: commit 046e3af8a9127df8eac879454f029937c8a31c41 Author: rasbt <mail@sebastianraschka.com> Date: Tue Nov 24 03:46:37 2015 -0500 fixed setup.py commit c3c00f6ba0e8f48bbe1c9081b8ae3817e57ecc5c Author: rasbt <mail@sebastianraschka.com> Date: Tue Nov 24 03:04:39 2015 -0500 documented feature x commit d87934fe8726c46f0b166d6290a3bf38915d6e75 Author: rasbt <mail@sebastianraschka.com> Date: Tue Nov 24 02:44:45 2015 -0500 added support for feature x Assuming that it would make sense to group these 3 commits into one, we can execute $ git rebase -i HEAD~3 which will bring our default git editor with the following contents: pick d87934f added support for feature x pick c3c00f6 documented feature x pick 046e3af fixed setup.py Since c3c00f6 and 046e3af are related to the original commit of feature x , let's keep the d87934f and squash the 2 following commits into this initial one by changes the lines to pick d87934f added support for feature x squash c3c00f6 documented feature x squash 046e3af fixed setup.py Now, save the changes in your editor. Now, quitting the editor will apply the rebase changes, and the editor will open a second time, prompting you to enter a new commit message. In this case, we could enter support for feature x to summarize the contributions. 8. Uploading changes Push your changes to a topic branch to the git server by executing: $ git push origin <feature_branch> 9. Submitting a pull request Go to your GitHub repository online, select the new feature branch, and submit a new pull request: Notes for Developers Building the documentation The documentation is built via MkDocs ; to ensure that the documentation is rendered correctly, you can view the documentation locally by executing mkdocs serve from the mlxtend/docs directory. For example, ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ mkdocs serve 1. Building the API documentation To build the API documentation, navigate to mlxtend/docs and execute the make_api.py file from this directory via ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ python make_api.py This should place the API documentation into the correct directories into the two directories: mlxtend/docs/sources/api_modules mlxtend/docs/sources/api_subpackes 2. Editing the User Guide The documents containing code examples for the \"User Guide\" are generated from IPython Notebook files. In order to convert a IPython notebook file to markdown after editing, please follow the following steps: Modify or edit the existing notebook. Execute all cells in the current notebook and make sure that no errors occur. Convert the notebook to markdown using the ipynb2markdown.py converter ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ python ipynb2markdown.py --ipynb ./sources/user_guide/subpackage/notebookname.ipynb Note If you are adding a new document, please also include it in the pages section in the mlxtend/docs/mkdocs.yml file. 3. Building static HTML files of the documentation First, please check the documenation via localhost (https://127.0.0.1:8000/): ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ mkdocs serve Next, build the static HTML files of the mlxtend documentation via ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ mkdocs build --clean To deploy the documentation, execute ~/github/mlxtend/docs$ mkdocs gh-deploy --clean 4. Generate a PDF of the documentation To generate a PDF version of the documentation, simply cd into the mlxtend/docs directory and execute: python md2pdf.py Uploading a new version to PyPI 1. Creating a new testing environment Assuming we are using conda , create a new python environment via $ conda create -n 'mlxtend-testing' python=3 numpy scipy pandas Next, activate the environment by executing $ source activate mlxtend-testing 2. Installing the package from local files Test the installation by executing the following from within the mlxtend main directory: $ pip install . -e the --record files.txt flag will create a files.txt file listing the locations where these files will be installed. Try to import the package to see if it works, for example, by executing $ python -c 'import mlxtend; print(mlxtend.__file__)' If everything seems to be fine, remove the installation via $ cat files.txt | xargs rm -rf ; rm files.txt Next, test if pip is able to install the packages. First, navigate to a different directory, and from there, install the package: $ pip uninstall $ pip install mlxtend and uninstall it again $ pip uninstall mlxtend 3. Deploying the package Consider deploying the package to the PyPI test server first. The setup instructions can be found here . First , install Twine if you don't have it already installed. E.g., use the following to install all recommended packages: $ python -m pip install twine build Second , create the distribution. This by default creates an sdist and wheel in the ./dist directory. $ python -m build Install the wheel and sdist to make sure they work. The distributions file names will change with each version. python -m pip install ./dist/mlxtend-0.23.0.dev0.tar.gz --force-reinstall python -m pip install ./dist/mlxtend-0.23.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall python -m pip uninstall mlxtend Third , upload the packages to the test server: $ twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy dist/ Then, install it and see if it works: $ pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi mlxtend Next, uninstall it again as follows: $ pip uninstall mlxtend Fourth , after this dry-run succeeded, repeat this process using the \"real\" PyPI: $ python -m twine upload dist/* 4. Removing the virtual environment Finally, to cleanup our local drive, remove the virtual testing environment via $ conda remove --name 'mlxtend-testing' --all Note : if you get an error like HTTPError: 403 Forbidden from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ make sure you have an up to date version of twine installed (helped me to uninstall in conda and install via pip.) 5. Updating the conda-forge recipe Once a new version of mlxtend has been uploaded to PyPI, update the conda-forge build recipe at https://github.com/conda-forge/mlxtend-feedstock by changing the version number in the recipe/meta.yaml file appropriately.","title":"How To Contribute"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute","text":"I would be very happy about any kind of contributions that help to improve and extend the functionality of mlxtend.","title":"How to Contribute"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#quick-contributor-checklist","text":"This is a quick checklist about the different steps of a typical contribution to mlxtend (and other open source projects).

There are two ways you can do this: Option A : Running the tools manually [ ] Check for style issues by running flake8 ./mlxtend (you may want to run pytest again after you made modifications to the code) [ ] We recommend using black to format the code automatically according to recommended style changes. After installing black , you can do this via black [source_file_or_directory] [ ] Run isort which will sort the imports alphabetically. We recommend the following command: isort -p mlxtend --line-length 88 --multi-line 3 --profile black mypythonfile.py Option B : Using pre-commit hooks (recommended) The pre-commit hooks for mlxtend will check your code via flake8 , black , and isort automatically before you make a git commit .

Upgrading via pip To upgrade an existing version of mlxtend from PyPI, execute pip install mlxtend --upgrade --no-deps Please note that the dependencies (NumPy and SciPy) will also be upgraded if you omit the --no-deps flag; use the --no-deps (\"no dependencies\") flag if you don't want this. Installing mlxtend from the source distribution In rare cases, users reported problems on certain systems with the default pip installation command, which installs mlxtend from the binary distribution (\"wheels\") on PyPI. If you should encounter similar problems, you could try to install mlxtend from the source distribution instead via pip install --no-binary :all: mlxtend Also, I would appreciate it if you could report any issues that occur when using pip install mlxtend in hope that we can fix these in future releases. Conda The mlxtend package is also available through conda forge . To install mlxtend using conda, use the following command: conda install mlxtend --channel conda-forge or simply conda install mlxtend if you added conda-forge to your channels ( conda config --add channels conda-forge ). Dev Version The mlxtend version on PyPI may always one step behind; you can install the latest development version from the GitHub repository by executing pip install git+git://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend.git Or, you can fork the GitHub repository from https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend and install mlxtend from your local drive via pip install .","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installing-mlxtend","text":"","title":"Installing mlxtend"},{"location":"installation/#pypi","text":"To install mlxtend, just execute pip install mlxtend Alternatively, you download the package manually from the Python Package Index https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlxtend , unzip it, navigate into the package, and use the following command from inside the mlxtend folder: pip install .","title":"PyPI"},{"location":"installation/#upgrading-via-pip","text":"To upgrade an existing version of mlxtend from PyPI, execute pip install mlxtend --upgrade --no-deps Please note that the dependencies (NumPy and SciPy) will also be upgraded if you omit the --no-deps flag; use the --no-deps (\"no dependencies\") flag if you don't want this.","title":"Upgrading via pip"},{"location":"installation/#installing-mlxtend-from-the-source-distribution","text":"In rare cases, users reported problems on certain systems with the default pip installation command, which installs mlxtend from the binary distribution (\"wheels\") on PyPI.
